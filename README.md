**Project Description**

**Text Processing and Data Management Tool**

This JavaFX application serves a dual purpose: it provides advanced text processing capabilities using regular expressions and offers comprehensive data management functionality for various collection types. The project is designed with a modular approach, separating the user interface (UI) from the core logic to enhance maintainability and scalability.

**Key Features**

**1.	Text Processor:**

**o	Search:** Locate patterns within text using regular expressions.

**o	Match:** Verify if the entire text matches a given regular expression.

**o	Replace:** Substitute matched patterns with specified replacement text.

**o	UI(user-interface):** Easy input fields for text, regex patterns, and replacement text, along with clear display of results.

****2.	**Data Management:******

**o	Collection Types:** Manage collections such as Lists, Sets, and Maps.

**o	CRUD Operations:** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the selected collection.

**o	Item Operations:** Add new items, update selected items, and find items within the collection.

**o	Real-Time Display:** View and interact with the contents of the collections dynamically.

**o	Duplicate Handling:** Informs the user when attempting to add duplicate items to a Set.

**Architecture**

•	**Modular Design:** Separation of concerns is achieved by dividing the application into components.
•	**Event Handling:** Logical operations are handled and triggered by user interactions defined itno these components.
•	**JavaFX:** Utilizes **JavaFX for a responsive and intuitive graphical user interface.

**Use Cases**

**•	Text Processing:** Ideal for developers, data analysts, and anyone needing to manipulate and search through text using regex.
**•	Data Management:** Useful for users who need to manage collections of data, offering a simple interface to perform common operations on Lists, Sets, and Maps.
